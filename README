This project looks into developing an AutoEncoder model and utilizing the CIFAR 10 model.

- Jupyter Notebook is used to code
- Three Denoising Autoencoders are generated each with 100 EPOCH training
    - DAE  - supervised model using MSE loss function
    - DAE2 - supervised model using BinaryCrossEntropy loss function
    - DAE3 - unsupervised model using MSE loss function

The predicted models are evaluated using Image Quality Metrics
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- SSIM (Structured Similary Index)

The models are also evaluated on Flower Dataset from TensorFlow
